### Hello, everyone! ❤️
My nick...name is Koine, and I'm a student willing to learn how to simulate, construct, and design my own **virtual-world**!

I mainly use javascript based languages for web and the other else. For now, I'm seldom making games with webpage or a Kakaotalk messenger-bot. The latter has no dynamic interactive systems like GUI, sound, and AI. It's very small... and unofficial platform for development. Despite of it, I really like this environment. I can only be concentrated in algorithm and designing the architecture of my game's complex and optimized system. Likewise for studying.

Would you like to join me? or...... 혹시나 제가 언젠가 이곳을 담임선생님, 프로그래밍 선생님이나 개인적으로 절 가르쳐주신 분께 공유드린다면, 방문해주셔서 감사합니다!
